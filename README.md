# Network Automation Stacks

This repository will house many different flavors of an automation stack that can be implemented within an organization. The goal of the repository is to help network automation engineers understand the main components required to build and manage successful network automation stack and provide the skill of integrating disparate systems into an automation platform for users to incorporate in their day to day tasks.

> The main caveat here is the solutions will be open source products as this repository will be used for hands-on experience building and managing different automation stacks.
