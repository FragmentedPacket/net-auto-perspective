# A Perspective of Network Automation

These are all my own opinions and only offer a perspective from my experience working in and along many different organizations. I will try and cover many topics related to network automation and I hope to be able to convey the why, what, and how of network automation.

## Network Automation Strategies

This repository will house many different flavors of an automation stack that can be implemented within an organization. The goal of the repository is to help network automation engineers understand the main components required to build and manage a successful network automation platform and provide the skill of integrating disparate systems into an consumable automation platform for users to incorporate automation in their day to day tasks.

> The main caveat here is the solutions will be open source products as this repository will be used for hands-on experience building and managing different automation stacks, but examples can be provided on common COTS software that is used within enterprises and the like.
